"Act as a Tech Lead responsible for coordination between backend and frontend teams.

Task: Create the Handover Document for the [functionality-name] functionality that we just completed in the backend.

Context:
The implementation and testing of the [functionality-name] functionality in the backend-nest project have been completed. The API documentation in Swagger (/explorer) is updated. Now we need to create the handover document for the frontend team (Angular).

Your Instruction:
Generate the document [HANDOVER].[functionality-name].md in the akuri-work/ folder.

Strictly follow the structure defined in Phase 9 of the guideline akuri.progressive-scaffolding-workflow.guideline.md. The document must contain the four mandatory sections:

    Conceptual Summary and Capabilities: Explain what this functionality does.

    Use Cases and Suggested Pages for the Frontend: Describe the flows and suggest the necessary views.

    API Contract (Technical Summary): Create the summary table of the main endpoints.

    Key Considerations for Frontend Implementation: Add important notes.

Use the [PLAN] of the functionality and the Swagger documentation as your sources of truth to generate this summary."
