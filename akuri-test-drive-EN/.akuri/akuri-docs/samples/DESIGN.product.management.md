# DESIGN: Product Management

## 1. Environment Description
The solution will operate in the AKURI_TEST platform backend, using NestJS as the main framework for REST APIs, TypeORM for interaction with a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL), and Node.js as runtime. The development environment includes tools like Swagger for API documentation, Jest for unit tests, and integration with the Angular frontend via HTTP. The infrastructure is local (localhost:3000) but prepared for deployment in Docker containers, with technological restrictions defined in the manifest to ensure consistency.

## 2. Solution Explanation
We will implement a product module as a centralized service in NestJS, with controllers that expose REST endpoints for CRUD operations. Each product will have basic attributes (id, name, description, price, stock), validated in DTOs to ensure integrity. Business logic will be encapsulated in services, separating responsibilities: the controller handles requests/responses, the service manages business rules and validations, and the repository (via TypeORM) interacts with the database. This creates a modular and scalable architecture, allowing future extensions like categories or suppliers without breaking the core.

## 3. How It Solves the Problems
This solution addresses the inventory management need by providing a robust and documented API that the frontend can consume to display, create, and edit products. It solves the lack of persistence by integrating TypeORM, ensuring consistent and recoverable data. For the defined scope, it covers basic CRUD without overloading with non-required features, maintaining simplicity and focus.

## 4. How It Guarantees Acceptance Criteria
- **Functional endpoints:** NestJS controllers will guarantee correct responses through decorators and middlewares.
- **Validations and tests:** DTOs with class-validator and unit tests in Jest will achieve >80% coverage, verifying business rules.
- **Documentation and access:** Swagger will auto-generate accessible docs at /explorer, facilitating integration.
- **Performance:** Asynchronous structure and query optimizations will maintain <500ms, with support for 100 concurrent products via connection pooling.
- **No errors:** Integrated logging and global exception handling will prevent failures in logs during testing.
