# ⚠️ WARNING: Experimental Project Status ⚠️

Thank you for your interest in the Akuri-OMA methodology. Before you proceed, it is crucial that you read and understand the following points.

## 1. This is an Experimental Project

Akuri-OMA is currently in an **active and experimental development phase**. The concepts, guidelines, workflows, and prompts are subject to significant changes, refactoring, or even complete removal without prior notice.

**By using this methodology, you acknowledge that you are participating in an experiment. You assume all risks associated with its use.**

## 2. Intended for Experienced Developers

This methodology is **NOT recommended for novice or junior developers** without the direct and constant supervision of an experienced senior developer.

- **High Level of Abstraction:** Akuri-OMA requires a solid understanding of software architecture principles, design patterns, and the specific technology stack you are working with.
- **Requires Discipline:** The methodology is intentionally rigid. It demands a high degree of discipline and a commitment to following the process, which can be challenging for those new to structured development.
- **Focus on "Why", Not Just "How":** The goal is to understand the principles of Specification-Driven Development (SDD). A junior developer might focus on completing a task, while the methodology requires focusing on the correctness of the process.

**Using this system without the necessary experience may lead to frustration, incorrect implementations, and counterproductive results.**

## 3. High Configurability and User Responsibility

Akuri-OMA is designed to be a highly configurable governance layer, not a black box. **The user (the Supervisor) is in complete control and, therefore, is completely responsible for the outcome.**

- **Direct Configuration:** You can (and are encouraged to) modify the `guidelines`, `prompts`, and `manifests` to adapt the methodology to your specific needs.
- **Indirect Configuration:** The way you interact with the AI agent, the quality of your feedback, and the decisions you make during the approval gates directly influence the agent's behavior and the quality of the final code.

An incorrect configuration or a poorly supervised process will inevitably lead to poor results. The system is a powerful tool, but its effectiveness depends entirely on the skill of the operator.

## 4. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability

- **No Guarantees:** This project is provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind, express or implied. We do not guarantee that it will meet your requirements, that it will be error-free, or that it will produce functional or secure code.
- **Use at Your Own Risk:** In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.
- **AI is a Tool:** Remember that the AI agent is a tool being guided by this methodology. It can still make mistakes, generate incorrect code, or "hallucinate". Your role as the Supervisor is to catch these errors through the structured review and approval process.

**By cloning, forking, or using this methodology in any way, you are explicitly agreeing to these terms.**
