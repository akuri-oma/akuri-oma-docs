# REQUIREMENT: Product Management

## 1. Purpose
Implement a product management module in the backend to allow CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on products. This will facilitate inventory administration in the application, integrating with the Angular frontend to display and manage products efficiently.

## 2. Scope
- **Includes:**
  - REST endpoints for product CRUD.
  - Basic validations (required name, positive price).
  - Database integration (using TypeORM as per manifest).
  - API documentation with Swagger.
- **Excludes:**
  - Frontend logic (handled in angular-frontend).
  - Authentication/authorization (assumed globally implemented).
  - Advanced reports or analytics.

## 3. Limitations
- Must use only NestJS and TypeORM (as per nest-backend project.manifest.md).
- Compatible with AKURI_TEST platform (no external services like Firebase).
- Performance: Support for at least 100 concurrent products without degradation.
- Feasibility: Technically and realistically possible within the defined stack.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- Endpoints respond correctly to POST/GET/PUT/DELETE requests.
- Validations pass unit tests with >80% coverage.
- API documented and accessible at http://localhost:3000/explorer.
- Response time <500ms for simple operations.
- No errors in logs during basic load testing.
