# How to Contribute to Akuri-OMA

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the Akuri-OMA methodology! Your involvement helps us build a more robust, versatile, and effective framework for AI-assisted software development.

We welcome all types of contributions, from fixing typos in the documentation to proposing major changes to the workflows or adapting the methodology to new technologies.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways you can contribute to the project:

###  reporting Bugs or Suggesting Enhancements
- **Report a bug:** If you find a mistake, an inconsistency, or an unclear section in our documentation or example projects, please [open an issue](https://github.com/your-username/akuri-oma-methodology/issues).
- **Suggest an enhancement:** If you have an idea for a new feature, a new `guideline`, or a way to improve an existing workflow, we'd love to hear it. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/your-username/akuri-oma-methodology/issues) to start the discussion.

### Proposing Changes with Pull Requests

If you want to make a change yourself, the general process is:

1.  **Fork the repository** and create a new branch from `main`.
2.  **Make your changes.** Please ensure your changes are consistent with the overall philosophy of the methodology.
3.  **Submit a Pull Request (PR).** In your PR description, please explain the "why" behind your change and link it to any relevant issues.

### Types of Contributions We're Looking For

#### 1. Documentation Improvements
-   Clarifying explanations in the `docs/` folder.
-   Fixing typos and grammatical errors.
-   Adding more examples to the `guidelines`.

#### 2. Translations
-   The core documentation is in Spanish and English. We would be thrilled to receive contributions to translate the `/docs/` into other languages (e.g., `/docs/pt/`, `/docs/de/`).

#### 3. Adapting to New Technologies
-   This is one of the most valuable contributions! If you are an expert in a technology like **React, Vue, Svelte, Django, Ruby on Rails, etc.**, you can help by:
    1.  Opening an issue to discuss how Akuri-OMA's principles can be adapted to that tech stack.
    2.  Creating a new set of `guidelines` for that technology inside the `/examples/[technology-name]/` folder.
    3.  Once validated, we can integrate it into the main methodology.

#### 4. Improving the Example Projects
-   Enhancing the `akuri-oma-example-nestjs` or `akuri-oma-example-angular` projects to better demonstrate a principle.
-   Adding new features to the example projects that showcase more advanced use cases of the methodology.

## Getting Started

Before you start, please take a moment to read the core documentation to understand the philosophy behind Akuri-OMA. The best place to start is the **[Introduction to Akuri-OMA](./docs/en/01-akuri-oma-intro.en.md)**.

We look forward to your contributions!
